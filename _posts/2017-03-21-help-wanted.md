Howdy! :)

First of all wanted to inform any interested people - Licket is not dead, just didn't have much time recently. I'm asking you then - if you are willing to help me with moving Licket development forward please pretty pleeeease do it!

Check the source code, read it carefuly and do some suggestions! Feel free to create pull request stuff, I'll do my best to find some spare time to check it out!

Any, literally any help appreciated ...
